<h1>About Potato AimLabs</h1>
  
#### Potato Aim Labs is an aim trainer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It provides a fun and challenging environment for improving your aim and reflexes.
The aim trainer features a time limit of 45 seconds, after which it automatically resets, allowing you to continuously practice and strive for better scores.
At the top of the interface, you'll find a scoreboard displaying your current score, remaining time, total missed hits, and frames per second (FPS) information.
To aim and shoot, you must hit the randomly spawning balls using a custom CS:GO crosshair.
The objective is to achieve the highest score possible within the given time frame.
